Around the World in 80 Days
===========================

A Dynamic Infographic made with [love](https://love2d.org).

It uses bezier curves for drawing paths, and tweens for interpolating between different frames.

It is based on Jules Verne's Around the World in 80 Days, and pulls quotes from the text in order to show how Mr. Fogg changes (or doesn't change) throughout the story.

The source code was primarily meant to be used for this project, and as a result, almost everything is hardcoded and cannot be used in other projects. I might work in the future on creating a better framework, but for now, try (and probably fail) to understand how it works, and then use what you learn to implement something better fit for your project.

I release this code into the public domain. You can literally do whatever it is that you want with it. I really do not care, and I don't want to deal with licensing.
